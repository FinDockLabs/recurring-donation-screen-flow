# Screen flow: Create NPSP Recurring Donation with FinDock BACS

A simple screen flow for use from a Contact record to create a Recurring Donation in NPSP, including the creation of a FinDock Payment Profile for storing the account details for BACS. The flow also harnesses FinDock's bank account checker to validate the account number and sort code before creation.

## Installation

Simply install and activate the flow (Screen Flow - BACS Recurring Donation). You can then include it on your Contact page layout or trigger it an Action on the Contact object. (When adding to a Page Layout, make sure to tick the checkbox to Pass the record ID into the variable recordId.)

## Notes

This is only meant to be a starter to get you going - feel free to customise this flow to meet the needs of your nonprofit with additional fields and actions.
